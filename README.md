# Limi.to

The cleanest way to create links that expire when you want.

Limi.to is a simple, premium‑feeling service for creating links that automatically expire on your terms. Choose a date or a click limit, share a single short link, and when time’s up it can gracefully redirect to a page you choose or show a friendly “link expired” message. Manage everything from a lightweight dashboard and see at‑a‑glance stats like total clicks and the last time a link was used.

Perfect for time‑limited offers, launch previews, job applications, private documents, event RSVPs, and anything that shouldn’t live forever. Fast, clean, and distraction‑free—so your links do exactly what you expect, no clutter, just control.
