# Limi.to ‚Äî MVP (v1) Development Blueprint

> **Tagline:** ‚ÄúThe cleanest way to create links that expire when you want.‚Äù
> **Goal:** Launch a simple, fast, and monetizable SaaS that can reach $500 MRR with minimal complexity.

---

## üß≠ Overview

## üñåÔ∏è Visual Design Rules

- **Light and Dark themes** using shadcn/ui CSS variables.
- Keep layout **minimal** but **visually professional** ‚Äî clean shadows, subtle borders.
- Use a **professional color palette** based on shadcn/ui defaults:
  - Primary: Blue (`hsl(221.2 83.2% 53.3%)`)
  - Secondary: Gray (`hsl(210 40% 96.1%)`)
  - Muted: Light gray for backgrounds
  - Border: Subtle gray borders
- Typography: Inter (clean, geometric, professional).
- Use meaningful icons from `lucide-react` ‚Äî not decoration for decoration's sake.
- Ensure accessibility: proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
- Design inspiration: Linear.app, Bitly.com, Linklyhq.com ‚Äî clean, minimal, conversion-focused.ts users create **expiring links** (by date or click count), view basic analytics, and optionally redirect expired links to a fallback URL.

Your mission: **build something clean, fast, and scalable**, not big and complicated.

---

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers (Edge runtime for redirects, Node for app logic)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password + magic link)
- **Email:** Resend + React Email (optional for notifications)
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout (added after launch)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend + backend), Supabase (DB)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (optional), Vercel Analytics

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure Rules

Codex should **create a clean, modular structure**.
No single-file blobs. No unstructured folders.

**General organization:**

- All application logic inside `/app`
- Components grouped logically (not alphabetically)
- Shared utilities go in `/lib`
- Types live in `/types`
- Styles under `/styles`
- Tests separated into `/tests/unit`, `/tests/integration`, `/tests/e2e`

**General hierarchy example (not strict):**

```
/limito
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/ ‚Üí Routes, pages, API endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/ ‚Üí Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/ ‚Üí Supabase client, validators, helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emails/ ‚Üí React Email templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/ ‚Üí Global TypeScript interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/ ‚Üí Tailwind and global CSS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/ ‚Üí All automated tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**Key principles for structure:**

- One purpose per file.
- One domain per folder (e.g., `/api/links` for all link endpoints).
- Keep files short, simple, and type-safe.
- No mixed concerns (e.g., don‚Äôt mix DB and UI in one file).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Coding Rules

### üß© General (applies to both frontend and backend)

1. **No inline comments** ‚Äî code must be self-documenting.
2. **No console logs** ‚Äî use structured error handling or logging utilities.
3. **No playground or temporary files** ‚Äî all test or debug code must live in `/tests`.
4. **No unused imports, no dead code, no TODOs.**
5. **No `any` type** ‚Äî always use explicit TypeScript types or interfaces.
6. **Validate all user input with Zod** before inserting or updating data.
7. **Every API route must return a valid HTTP code and consistent JSON structure.**
8. **All environment variables must come from `process.env`.**
9. **Avoid hardcoded values.** Use constants, enums, or configuration files.
10. **Strict mode enabled** in both TypeScript and Next.js.
11. **Run lint and tests before every commit.**
12. **Keep commits atomic and descriptive** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
13. **Never push broken builds** or untested code to `main`.
14. **GOLDEN RULE: IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK, DO NOT ASSUME A THING.**

---

### üé® Frontend Rules

1. **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.
2. **UI Components:** Use shadcn/ui components exclusively. Import from `@/components/ui/*`.
3. **Component naming:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `LinkForm.tsx`, `ButtonPrimary.tsx`).
4. **Hook names:** `useCamelCase` (e.g., `useCopyToClipboard.ts`).
5. **Utility functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDate.ts`).
6. **File and folder names:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `link-form.tsx`, `link-table.tsx`).
7. **CSS:** Use Tailwind utilities + shadcn/ui CSS variables. No external CSS frameworks.
8. **Styling helper:** Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` to merge Tailwind classes.
9. **No business logic in components.**
   - Components should only handle UI and minor state.
   - Move side effects, validation, and data fetching into hooks or server actions.
10. **Use React Server Components** whenever possible; avoid unnecessary client components.
11. **Always validate props with TypeScript interfaces.**
12. **Mobile-first design:**
    - Test at 360px width minimum.
    - Keep spacing and typography consistent.
13. **Error and loading states required** for all async UI sections.
14. **No direct calls to Supabase or API endpoints inside UI components.**
    - Use custom hooks or actions for data fetching.
15. **GOLDEN RULE: IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK, DO NOT ASSUME A THING.**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Rules

1. **Language:** TypeScript with Next.js Route Handlers.
2. **Function naming:** `camelCase` (e.g., `createLink`, `getLinkStats`).
3. **File names:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `create-link.ts`, `redirect-link.ts`).
4. **Database interaction:**
   - All queries through Supabase SDK or `pg` with prepared statements.
   - No direct SQL strings in UI code.
5. **Input validation:** All route handlers must validate body/query with Zod before processing.
6. **Response standardization:**
   - Success ‚Üí `{ "success": true, "data": ... }`
   - Error ‚Üí `{ "error": true, "message": "..." }`
7. **Error handling:**
   - Use try/catch in all route handlers.
   - Return proper HTTP codes:
     - 200/201 (OK / Created)
     - 400 (Bad Request)
     - 401 (Unauthorized)
     - 403 (Forbidden)
     - 404 (Not Found)
     - 500 (Server Error)
8. **Database schema updates:**
   - Always via Supabase migrations.
   - Never modify DB structure directly in production.
9. **Security:**
   - Enforce RLS on all tables.
   - Never expose Supabase service key in the client.
   - Sanitize all URLs before redirecting.
10. **Logging:**
    - Use structured logs for server errors (Sentry or Vercel logs).
    - Do not log sensitive data (tokens, emails, etc.).
11. **GOLDEN RULE: IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK, DO NOT ASSUME A THING.**

## üñåÔ∏è Visual Design Rules

- **Light and Dark themes** required from day one.
- Keep layout **minimal** but **visually premium** ‚Äî use gradients, smooth shadows, and subtle motion.
- Use a **2‚Äì3 color palette**, primarily:
  - `#2d5dc5` (Primary Blue)
  - `#f26749` (Accent Coral)
  - `#f1ede5` (Neutral background)
- Typography: clean and geometric (Inter, Work Sans, or Poppins).
- Use meaningful icons (Lucide, Heroicons) ‚Äî not decoration for decoration‚Äôs sake.
- Ensure accessibility: proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Copywriting & Messaging Tone

The UI copy, landing pages, and dashboard text must reflect:

- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Confidence over complexity**
- **Trust, privacy, and control**

**Tone:**
Friendly, trustworthy, and slightly conversational ‚Äî like you‚Äôre talking to a smart, busy user who values clarity.

### Example Style

> ‚ÄúCreate links that expire when you want. Simple, safe, and beautiful.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúControl your links ‚Äî decide when they vanish.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe fastest way to share links that know when to stop working.‚Äù

Keep microcopy short, sharp, and benefit-driven (like Linkly or Rebrandly).

---

## üß≠ Design Goals

1. Feel **modern and startup-grade**, not corporate.
2. Prioritize **user confidence and transparency**.
3. Every view should answer one question instantly: _‚ÄúWhat can I do here?‚Äù_
4. Animate only where it improves clarity.
5. Minimal friction from landing to action ‚Äî maximum polish.

---

---

## üß™ Testing Rules

- All tests inside `/tests`.
- Unit ‚Üí validation, expiration logic.
- Integration ‚Üí CRUD routes.
- E2E ‚Üí redirect + dashboard flow.
- No inline testing, no mock playgrounds.
- Use Playwright for browser tests.
- CI pipeline runs tests before deployment.

---

## üì¶ Deployment Rules

1. Deploy DB schema to Supabase.
2. Set environment variables in Vercel.
3. Deploy Next.js to Vercel (Edge runtime enabled).
4. Verify:
   - Auth works
   - Redirect latency < 100ms
   - Expiration logic triggers correctly

---

## ‚öôÔ∏èEnvironment Variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=
APP_URL=https://limi.to
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

---

## üí° Development Workflow

- Before finishing up a feature please run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` to check if there are any errors.
- Create a **TODO list** for each feature that you're going to implement and as soon as that list is complete, commit the feature.
- **Branch naming:** `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`
- Each feature should be committed
- **Commits:** Must be atomic and descriptive.
- **Pull Requests:** Always include purpose and screenshots for UI.
- **Pre-deploy checks:** run `pnpm run lint && pnpm run test`.
- **No direct pushes** to `main`.

### Instructions Sync

- Keep `.github/instructions/limito-instructions.md.instructions.md` and this file in sync. Any change to rules or design guidance in one must be mirrored in the other in the same PR.

### Commit Gating (Approval Required)

- After changes are implemented, do not commit immediately.
- First run: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm test` to ensure zero errors.
- Share a short summary of edits and verification status with the user.
- Proceed to commit only after explicit user approval.

---

## üß† Quality Principles

- Code must be clear enough to explain itself.
- Fewer lines over fancy abstractions.
- Simplicity is a feature.
- Launch before perfection.
- If you can explain it in one sentence ‚Äî it‚Äôs good code.

---
